# Optimization-of-Feed-Mix-Composition
The **Feed Mix Optimization Project** uses linear programming to design cost-effective and nutritionally balanced agricultural feed mixes. The project focuses on achieving three main goals: reducing costs, minimizing the number of ingredients, and maintaining nutritional standards. The resulting solution provides a strategic tool for optimizing feed formulations while simplifying supply chain logistics.

## Key Features

- **Streamlined Ingredient Selection**  
   The project introduces binary variables to determine ingredient inclusion, focusing on minimizing the number of ingredients in the feed mix. This approach simplifies procurement and supply chain logistics by reducing ingredient diversity while maintaining nutritional integrity.

- **Cost Optimization**  
   Using linear programming, the project identifies the most cost-effective combination of ingredients. The optimization ensures that all nutritional requirements are met while keeping costs as low as possible, enabling efficient resource allocation.

- **Balanced Nutritional Standards**  
   The model incorporates combined ingredient rules that define allowable proportions for specific nutrients, ensuring the feed mix adheres to balanced nutritional standards. This guarantees compliance with dietary guidelines for agricultural feed.

- **Trade-Off Analysis**  
   The project provides a visual and analytical exploration of trade-offs between minimizing ingredient variety and reducing costs. This analysis supports informed decision-making by highlighting how changes in one factor impact the other.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**  
   The project begins with loading and preprocessing data, including defining the parameters and constraints needed for optimization.

2. **Linear Programming Model Setup**  
   A linear programming model is constructed with variables representing ingredient inclusion, objective functions for minimizing cost and ingredient count, and constraints to ensure nutritional and budgetary requirements are met.

3. **Optimization Execution**  
   The optimization process identifies the ideal combination of ingredients that balances cost efficiency with nutritional standards.
